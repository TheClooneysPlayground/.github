🙋‍♀️ This is the **Playground** collection of two "generations" of [@NicholasClooney](https://github.com/NicholasClooney) and his previous identity [@NicholasTD07](https://github.com/NicholasTD07).

## Playground

Playground is where I play with ideas that wonders into my mind. 😁

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
